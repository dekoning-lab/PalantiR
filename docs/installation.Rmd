# Automatic installation

Using the `devtools` package, we can install from `github` directly:

```R
devtools::install_github("dekoning-lab/PalantiR")
```

# Manual installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dekoning-lab/PalantiR.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```R
install.packages(c("RcppArmadillo", "htmlwidgets"))
```

# MacOS

On MacOS, it might be necessary to install a `gfortran` compiler, for linear algebra libraries. See https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries for downloads.

# Issues

Calling `plot` may produce a following warning:

```
Warning message:
In structure(x, class = unique(c("AsIs", oldClass(x)))) :
  Calling 'structure(NULL, *)' is deprecated, as NULL cannot have attributes.
  Consider 'structure(list(), *)' instead.
```

This is a resolved [issue](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets/issues/269) with [htmlwdigets](https://github.com/ramnathv/htmlwidgets) package. It did not seem to have made it to `CRAN` yet. Until it does, install the package from github:

```R
detach("package:htmlwidgets", unload=TRUE)
devtools::install_github("ramnathv/htmlwidgets")
```

## Building

If using RStudio, hit "Build & Reload".

Otherwise, navigate to one directory above PalantiR, and run:

```bash
R CMD INSTALL --preclean --no-multiarch --with-keep.source PalantiR
```

Then, in a new R session, run:

```R
library(PalantiR)
```
