# Rate Matrix Scaling

`PalantiR` scales codon substitution rates to assign particular meanings to branches on a phylogeny.

## Scaling types

There are 3 scaling schemes implemented:

* `synonymous` is the default scaling. This forces the branch length to be proportional to the expected number of _synonymous_ substitutions per site.
* `non-synonymous` scaling forces the branch length to be equivalent to the expected number of _non-synonymous_ substitutions per site.
* `substitution` scaling forces the branch length to be equivalent to the expected number of _both_ types of substitutions per site.
* `none` can be specified to leave the substitution rates unscaled.

Scaling type is specified as an optional parameter to substitution model constructors, _e.g._:

```{r, eval=F}
MutationSelection(..., scaling_type = "synonymous")
```

## Implementation

Scaling rate is calculated as:

$$
S(Q, \pi, t) = \sum \sum_{ij}\pi_i Q_{ij}^{(t)}
$$

* $Q$ is the substitution rate matrix
* $\pi$ is the equilibrium distribution for $Q$
* $t$ is the scaling type (outlined above)

The inner summation is over all the substitutions from each state (codon) $i$ to each state $j$.
$Q^{(t)}$ means substitution rate for a substitution of type $t$ (e.g. synonymous substitution).
